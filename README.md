### Hello 👋

Hi, I'm Kyle! I'm a software engineer who loves solving hard problems. I'm proficient in:
  - HTML5/CSS
  - Javascript
  - React.js
  - Node.js
  - Python
  - PostgreSQL
  - many more, and I'm always learning new technologies. 

When I'm not writing code, you can find me surfing, reading, listening to music.
